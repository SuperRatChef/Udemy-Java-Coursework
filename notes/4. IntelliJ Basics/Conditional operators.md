The equality operator tests to see if two operands are considered equal, and returns a boolean value

bool isAlien = false;
if(isAlien == false){
	//this code snippet executes because isAlien is false too.
}

### other operators

### != 
inequality operator

### <
smaller than operator

### >
greater than operator

### <=
smaller or equal to operator

etc etc.

those are basically the same as on the python
