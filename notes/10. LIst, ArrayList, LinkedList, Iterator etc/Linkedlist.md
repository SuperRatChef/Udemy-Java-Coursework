A **LinkedList** in Java is a data structure that stores elements in a linear fashion, where each element is represented by a **node**. Each node contains two parts: the **data** and a reference (or link) to the **next node** in the list. In a doubly linked list, there is also a reference to the **previous node**.

Java provides the **LinkedList** class in the `java.util` package, which implements both the **List** and **Deque** interfaces. It is part of the Java Collections Framework and can be used to store dynamic data.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Dynamic Size:** Unlike arrays, the size of a linked list can grow or shrink dynamically.
- **Non-contiguous Memory:** Nodes are stored at different memory locations, which makes insertions and deletions more efficient than arrays.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Java's `LinkedList` is a doubly linked list, meaning each node points to both the next and previous nodes.

#### Key Methods:

- `add(E element)`: Adds the element at the end of the list.
- `add(int index, E element)`: Inserts the element at the specified index.
- `remove()`: Removes and returns the first element.
- `remove(int index)`: Removes the element at the specified index.
- `get(int index)`: Returns the element at the specified index.
- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the list.
- `peek()`, `poll()`, `offer()`: Queue operations since `LinkedList` implements the **Deque** interface.

#### Performance:

- **Insertions/Deletions:** Efficient at the start or end of the list (O(1) for `addFirst()`, `removeFirst()`).
- **Random Access:** Slower compared to an array because elements are accessed sequentially (O(n) for `get(index)`).
