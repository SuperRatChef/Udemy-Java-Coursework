An **enum** in Java is a special data type that represents a group of constants. It is used to define collections of related constants in a more readable and structured way. Enums were introduced in Java 5 and are defined using the `enum` keyword.

#### Key Points:

- **Constants:** An enum is essentially a set of predefined constant values that represent fixed data, like days of the week, directions, or states.
- **Type-Safe:** Enums provide compile-time type safety, meaning only the defined constants can be used for variables of that enum type.
- **Class-Like Behavior:** Enums can have methods, fields, and constructors, making them more powerful than simple constants.
