`ArrayList` is a part of the Java Collection Framework, residing in the `java.util` package. It is a **resizable array implementation** of the `List` interface, meaning the size of the `ArrayList` can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.

Here are some important notes on `ArrayList` in Java:

### **Key Characteristics of `ArrayList`:**

- **Resizable**: Unlike arrays, `ArrayList` can automatically grow and shrink as elements are added or removed.
- **Indexed Access**: Elements can be accessed via zero-based indices, just like arrays.
- **Duplicates Allowed**: `ArrayList` allows storing duplicate elements.
- **Ordered**: It maintains the insertion order of elements.
- **Null Values**: It can store null values.
- **Non-Synchronized**: By default, `ArrayList` is not thread-safe. If used in multi-threaded environments, it needs to be manually synchronized.
