**Autoboxing** in Java is the automatic conversion of **primitive data types** (e.g., `int`, `char`, `boolean`) into their corresponding **wrapper class objects** (e.g., `Integer`, `Character`, `Boolean`). This feature was introduced in Java 5 to make it easier to work with collections, which can only store objects and not primitive types.

#### Key Points:

- **Primitive to Wrapper Conversion:** Autoboxing automatically converts primitives like `int`, `char`, and `boolean` into their corresponding wrapper classes `Integer`, `Character`, and `Boolean`.
- **Unboxing:** The reverse process, where a wrapper class is automatically converted back to a primitive, is called **unboxing**.

#### Advantages:

- **Simplifies Code:** Developers don't need to explicitly convert between primitives and objects, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

#### Caveats:

- **Performance Overhead:** Autoboxing introduces a slight performance cost due to the creation of wrapper objects.
- **Null Pointer Exceptions:** Unboxing can cause `NullPointerException` if the wrapper object is null.
