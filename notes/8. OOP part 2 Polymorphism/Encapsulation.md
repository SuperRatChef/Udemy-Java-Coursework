#### 1. **Definition**

- **Encapsulation** is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside **Inheritance**, **Abstraction**, and **Polymorphism**.
- It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or class.
- The data within a class is hidden from outside access and can only be accessed or modified via public methods, ensuring data integrity and security.

#### 2. **Why Encapsulation is Important**

- **Data Hiding**: Protects the internal state of an object from unintended or harmful external modifications.
- **Controlled Access**: The class controls how its data is accessed and modified using getters and setters, enforcing constraints.
- **Modular Code**: Each class manages its own data and behavior, promoting clean, modular, and maintainable code.
- **Flexible Maintenance**: Internal implementation can be changed without affecting the external code that interacts with the class, making it easier to update or refactor.

#### 3. **How Encapsulation Works in Java**

- **Private Data Members**: Variables (attributes) within a class are declared as `private` so they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
- **Public Getter and Setter Methods**: These methods allow controlled access to private variables. Getters retrieve values, and setters allow values to be updated while enforcing rules/validation.
#### 5. **Benefits of Encapsulation**

- **Data Protection**: The private variables cannot be accessed directly, reducing the risk of accidental or unauthorized modification.
- **Encapsulated Logic**: Setters can implement logic or validation to ensure the correctness of the data being set.
- **Flexibility**: Internal implementations can change without affecting external classes. For example, you can change how the data is stored or calculated internally without impacting how the class is used externally.
- **Maintainability**: Since the implementation is hidden from the user, future changes or updates can be made internally without affecting other parts of the code.

#### 6. **Key Points to Remember**

- **Private Data Members**: Always declare your class fields as `private` to encapsulate the data.
- **Public Accessors (Getters/Setters)**: Use public methods to provide controlled access to the private data.
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: While encapsulation hides the data, abstraction hides the implementation details. Encapsulation contributes to abstraction by controlling how data is accessed and modified.
- **Immutable Classes**: Encapsulation also leads to the creation of **immutable classes**, where data cannot be modified once set. This is done by omitting setters, making the object read-only.

#### 7. **Best Practices for Encapsulation**

- **Keep Fields Private**: Always make member variables `private` to ensure encapsulation.
- **Use Getters and Setters Appropriately**: Provide getters and setters only for fields that need to be accessed or modified by external code.
- **Validation in Setters**: Include validation logic inside setter methods to ensure data integrity.
- **Limit Access**: Make the setters and getters `protected` or `package-private` if the field should not be publicly accessible outside its package.
- **Immutable Fields**: For fields that shouldn't change after object creation, do not provide setters.

#### 8. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- **Public Fields**: Declaring fields as `public` violates encapsulation as it allows external modification without control.
- **No Validation in Setters**: Neglecting validation inside setters can result in invalid or inconsistent state.
- **Exposing Internal Objects**: If a getter returns a reference to a mutable object, external code can modify the internal state unintentionally.

#### 9. **UML Representation of Encapsulation**

- In **UML diagrams**, encapsulated fields are shown with a `-` (minus sign) for private fields and a `+` (plus sign) for public methods (getters/setters).
