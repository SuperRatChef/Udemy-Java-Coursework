String something = "This is a string";
System.out.println(something);


You can use strings in the same manner as the primitive datatypes even though its a class in a manner. This is due to the fact that string has little favouritism in java due to its usefulness on most of the operations.

You can concatenate strings via following maner:
lastString = lastString + doubleNumber;

You cannot specifically just alter the string(its immutable), but instead every time you make a change to the string, java will automatically create a new instance of the string on the background.
