The `super` keyword in Java is used to refer to the immediate parent class of the current object. It provides a way to access methods, constructors, and variables of the parent class when they are hidden or overridden in the child class. Here are the main uses of the `super` keyword:

#### **Accessing Parent Class Methods**

- The `super` keyword is used to call a method from the parent class if it has been overridden in the child class.
#### **Accessing Parent Class Variables**

- If the child class has variables with the same name as those in the parent class, `super` can be used to access the parent class's variable.

#### **Calling Parent Class Constructor**

- `super()` can be used to call the parent class constructor from the child class constructor.
