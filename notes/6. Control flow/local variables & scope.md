A local variable is called local because it is available for use by the code block in which it was declared

it is also available to code blocks that are contained by a declaring block

### When are local variables out of scope?
Local variables are always out of scope for outer blocks or the containing blocks they are declared in

#### Scope best practices
Declare and initialize variables in the same place, if possible
Also declare variables in the narrowest scope possible
