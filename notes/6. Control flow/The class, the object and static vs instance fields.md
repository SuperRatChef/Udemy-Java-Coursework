Attributes on classes are another way to store data

#### A class
-a custom data type
-a special code block that contains methods
-"describes a real life object template that can have functionality given on the nature of the objects existence and behaviour"

#### Object / instance
-its a created individual out of the class blueprints
-its holds its own unique data values separate from the other instances of the given object.

#### static
-requires static keyword when declared on the class
-value of the field is stored in special memory location and in only one place
-value can be shared between multiple different instances of other objects and methods.
