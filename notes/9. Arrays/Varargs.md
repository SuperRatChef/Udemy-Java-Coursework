In Java, **varargs** (short for _variable-length arguments_) allow you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a method. This feature was introduced in Java 5 and simplifies method declarations by allowing methods to accept zero or more arguments of the same type.

The syntax for varargs uses an ellipsis (`...`) to indicate that the method can accept a variable number of arguments.
